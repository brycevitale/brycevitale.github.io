    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I am currently completing my B.S. in Computer Science while pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity at Fordham University. I thrive in fast paced environments that require initiative and critical thinking with a team.</p>
    <p>I have worked as an IT Project Consultant at American IT Solutions since 2021, where I mainly manage B2B hardware deployments. I also develop automation scripts and coordinate operations to ensure timely delivery. Additionally, I co-founded DormDirect, an on-campus food delivery service where I thrived in development of the company along with marketing and logistics for a student run team.</p>
    <p>Outside of tech, I am an avid hockey player, band frontman, and Orientation Captain. I enjoy leading my community both on and off campus. From music to machine learning, I am always looking for opportunities to grow and make an impact.</p>
